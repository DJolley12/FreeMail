# FreeMail
FreeMail is an open-source email client for windows. Currently the only supported email platform is Gmail. There are capabilities to either configure the client to run in the 
background and notify you of emails through a number of different possible methods, i.e. subject, sender, etc. You can also send receive and do traditional email stuff.
